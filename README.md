Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
======================================================

- Download the [archived data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  into your working directory. Unzipping this file will create a
  'UCI HAR Dataset' subfolder, containing the needed data files.
- Make sure the run_analysis.R script is also in your working directory.
- Run the run_analysis.R script. In RStudio, you can do this by using
  source("run_analysis.R")
- The run_analysis.R script produces two files:
  - tidy_data.csv.txt (7.97MB)
  - tidy_averages.csv.txt (200KB)
