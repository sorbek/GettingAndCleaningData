# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project #

1. Download the [archived data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  into your working directory. Unzipping this file will create a
  'UCI HAR Dataset' subfolder, containing the needed data files.
1. Make sure the run\_analysis.R script is also in your working directory.
1. Run the run\_analysis.R script. This can be done in RStudio by typing
  *source("run\_analysis.R")* at the command prompt.
1. The run\_analysis.R script produces two files:
  - **tidy\_data.csv.txt** (7.97MB)
  - **tidy\_averages.csv.txt** (200KB)

> Note:
> - Coursera does not allow attaching files with a '.csv' extension. CSV files
>   need a '.txt' extension to be uploaded to Coursera. However, web browsers
>   may have difficulty displaying CSV files with a '.txt' extension. Therefore,
>   the same file with '.csv' extension is also available in this repository.
